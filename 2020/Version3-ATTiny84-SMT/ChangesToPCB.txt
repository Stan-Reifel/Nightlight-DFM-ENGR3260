	------------------------

 * Add a voltage reference to one of the AtoD inputs, then
   dial back the PWM when the battery voltage is high (extending the
   battery life and having a more consistent brightness).  Might also need
   decouple the VRef pin???

 * Might try lowering the 1M resistors to 470K??? (due to occasional 
   problems with the switch circuit)

 * Reduce the holes sizes for the ICSP connector and reposition it
   to the board's edge, so my clip-on compression ICSP connector can 
   be used.  Reduce the hole sizes to 0.038".
