
	Change to Nightlight PCB
	------------------------


Changes made For version 2.0 - 2021

 * For this round, I substitued the IRLML6344 for the IRLML6244 because 
   JLCPCB was out of stock of the IRLML6244

 * Lowered the 1M resistors (R1 and R2) to 680K (due to occasional problems  
   with the switch circuit)

 * Reduced the holes sizes for the ICSP connector and repositioned it
   to the board's edge (for my clip-on compression ICSP connector) 
   Hole sizes changed to 0.036" from 0.039"

Changes NOT made For version 2.0 - 2021
 * I decided not to add a voltage reference (that would be used to dial 
   back the PWM when the battery voltage is high, extending the battery 
   life and having more consistent brightness) because there where no
   unused pin.  The part that I was going to use was: REF3020AIDBZR
